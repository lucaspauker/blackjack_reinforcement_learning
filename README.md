# blackjack_reinforcement_learning

I recently read Ed Thorpe's Beat the Dealer, a book about how Thorpe, a mathematician, found a way to gain an edge in blackjack. In the book, Thorpe uses computer simulations to calculate the best blackjack strategy as well as card-counting strategies. Since I took a reinforcement learning class last quarter, I wanted to apply one of the most common algorithms, Q-learning, to to find the best strategy for blackjack.

Here is a blog post explaining the code: [https://www.lucaspauker.ml/articles/reinforcement-learning-applied-to-blackjack](https://www.lucaspauker.ml/articles/reinforcement-learning-applied-to-blackjack)
